                The Box View API (formerly Crocodoc) is a service for generating portable, web-viewable versions of documents
                <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
                    The new Box preview and View API both use Crocodoc's HTML5 document conversion technology to render documents in the browser. My main focus is building a world-class document viewer on top of this technology.

                    Here's an example of the document viewer we've built. &rarr;

            <!-- Background -->

            <section>
                We combine three web standards to render documents:
                <div class="logos">
                    <img class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" src="images/html5.svg" />
                    <span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3"><img class="fragment grow" data-fragment-index="3" src="images/svg.svg" /></span>
                    <img class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" src="images/css3.svg" />
                </div>

                <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
                    Our document rendering strategy (as you might have guessed), is based on SVG
                </aside>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Why SVG?</h2>

                <p data-markdown>*Can't you do everything with HTML + CSS?*</p>
                <p class="fragment" data-markdown>So, why not canvas?</p>

                <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
                    HTML5 is awesome, you can do so much with it!
                    Unfortunately, aside from rendering to a canvas, it's not possible to use only HTML &rarr;

                    So, what about canvas?

                    Canvas is an interesting option for rendering documents, but is much more complex to render and less portable

                    Also, then we'd be competing directly with PDF.js :) &rarr;

                    ## Why SVG?

                    * Provides functionality not currently possible with just HTML/CSS
                    * Converted assets are standard, portable, and lightweight
                    * Rendering fidelity is incredibly high
                    </script>
                </div>

                <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
                    so, why did we choose SVG? &rarr;

                    SVG provides some operations that aren't currently available with just HTML and CSS

                    * clipping and masking
                    * blending
                    * complex paths and subpixel positioning

                    though some of this functionality is on the horizon. &rarr;

                    Converted assets are all based on web standards, so they will just work in all standards-compliant browsers. Many other platforms are capable of interpreting and rendering SVG as well

                    SVG is just XML, just a text file, so it compresses very well on the wire, which is especially important for mobile &rarr;

                    SVG - scalable vector graphics have impeccable quality, with essentially infinite zooming that retains crispness (barring embedded rasterized images)

                    ## Several ways to embed SVG content

                    * `<img src="foo.svg">` and CSS `background-image`
                    * inline SVG (true inline vs DOMParser)

                    Having SVG as our rendering format has yielded many interesting problems for us when embedding in HTML

                    There are several ways to embed SVG content in HTML
                    * basic img tag or css background-image
                    * inline svg
                      * I'll talk about the what "true" inline SVG is, and what that means
                    * object, iframe, and embed tags
                      * I'll talk about these three tags and their differences (hint: there aren't really any differences)

                    ## Embed methods and their problems

                    * Performance and stability (#perfmatters!)

                <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
                    Each embed method has different implications regarding
                    * performance and stability
                      * regarding rendering and layout performance, what it means for UI/scrolling/zooming peformance
                      * mobile stability re: crashing and memory issues
                    * ability to load external assets or modify SVG content on the fly
                      * necessary for us because in some cases we need to rewrite relative paths to referenced assets in SVG or add queryString params for authentication and authorization purposes
                    * causing the native browser loading indicator
                      * it's annoying as all hell, and I'll show you what I mean by this, and how we were able to prevent it

                    If you look closely at Chrome's chrome (hehe), you can see the loading indicator flicker like crazy while the viewer is loading pages. This is completely unacceptable behavior for our use case. &rarr;

                    In Box document viewer, pages are loaded dynamically, making it possible to load a 1000+ page document performantly

                <small class="fragment">*at least not in Chrome/Blink</small>

                <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
                    In order to dynamically embed SVG content, it's necessary to use DOMParser or innerHTML to insert SVG content

                    At least in Chrome, invoking window.DOMParser bypasses the threaded html parser in blink, which causes a synchronous parse of the SVG content
                    In fact, the threaded html parser is not exposed to JS at all!

                <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
                    In Box documents, each page includes a separate, page-specific style tag in addition to a common external css file. With inline SVG, this limit would be reached very quickly.

                    There is no document.importNode in IE 9, but luckily there's a relatively simple shim for it, which involes traversing the DOM tree and essentially making a copy of each node in the tree

                    We've seen that inline SVG is not going to work, because the synchronous HTML parser is just too slow

                    There are several other options for embedding SVG content, so let's look at the img tag!

                <p class="fragment">Why not just use the &lt;img&gt; tag? SVG is an image format after all, and &lt;img&gt; supports SVG files...</p>

                <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
                    `&lt;img&gt;` tag supports SVG content pretty well, with the added bonus that it can be drawn to a canvas as a cache

                    Complex SVG can take time to layout and paint, and caching it to a canvas can protect against layout invalidation

                <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
                    Among other things, external assets aren't loaded when embedded with img tag (for security reasons)
                     (give an example of this)

                    For performane reasons, converted SVG files reference external assets (eg, fonts, images)

                    it is possible to base64 encode these assets and bake them into the SVG files

                    BUT although *images* are not commonly reused across pages, documents usually use the same set of fonts across many or all pages

                    if all necessary fonts were embedded into each individual svg file (instead of a common css file), it would increase the payload size by an unacceptable amount

                    we attempted to load all assets
                    fonts, styles with ajax
                    images with new Image() + canvas.toDataURL()

                    and base64 encode (window.btoa()) them into one large data url

                    this was extremely complex, and didn't seem to work very well in all browsers

                    it could be explored further, but probably not work the effort

                    image performance seems to be worse than iframe for some reason (though this could be remedied by caching to canvas)

                    canvas has its own performance issues (re: memory usage), causes crashing on mobile

                    In my testing, I've found that iframe, object, and embed are roughly equivalent when it comes to embedding SVG

                    Proxy.svg was our first attempt at a strategy that involves downloading SVG text via AJAX, modifying the content, and passing it to a child frame or object which then injects the content into itself. This resolves both the external assets issue (where we need to modify pathnames) and the browser loading indicator issue, because AJAX requests don't cause a spinner.

                    Unfortunately, we came up with the most complicated solution first, but I'll explain how it works, because it's quite interesting.
